## Introduction
Next word prediction is a common task in natural language processing (NLP). This project aims to develop a robust model that can accurately predict the next word based on the context provided by the preceding words.

## Installation
To get started with the project, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/next-word-prediction.git
cd next-word-prediction
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
To use the next word prediction model, run the following command:

```bash
python predict.py "Your input text here"
```

This will output the predicted next word based on the input text.

## Model Training
To train the model, follow these steps:

1. Prepare your dataset and place it in the `data/` directory.
2. Run the training script:

```bash
python train.py
```

3. The trained model will be saved in the `models/` directory.
